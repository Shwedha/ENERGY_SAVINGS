# ENERGY_SAVINGS
Energy saved from recycling:
Singapore has an ambitious goal of becoming a zero-waste nation. The amount of waste disposed of in Singapore has increased seven-fold over the last 40 years. At this rate, Semakau Landfill, Singaporeâ€™s only landfill, will run out of space by 2035. Making matters worse, Singapore has limited land for building new incineration plants or landfills.
The government would like to motivate citizens by sharing the total energy that the combined recycling efforts have saved every year. They have asked you to help them.
There are three sets of data:

1.datasets/wastestats.csv: Recycling statistics per waste type for the period 2003 to 2017, Source: Singapore National Environment Agency.

2.datasets/2018_2019_waste.csv : Recycling statistics per waste type for the period 2018 to 2019, Source: Singapore National Environment Agency.

3.datasets/energy_saved.csv: Estimations of the amount of energy saved per waste type in kWh. 

The task here is to analyse the data and sum up the values of energy saved per year from 2015 to 2019, by recycling glass, plastic, ferrous and non ferrous metals.
